These files have been tested with GHC 6.4

Core Library files:

Show.hs		Pretty Printing
ListUtils.hs	
PrintList.hs	
Probability.hs	Core probabilistic module
Visualize.hs	Visualization system for use with R

Examples:

Barber.hs		An example of the queueing system
BayesianNetwork.hs	Implementing Bayesian networks
Boys.hs			A statistical examples
NBoys.hs		A generalized version of the previous
Collection.hs		Collections and two examples:
			Marbles and cards
Dice.hs			Rolling dice
MontyHall.hs		The "Monty Hall" Game (statistical)
Predator.hs		Non-probabilistic, demonstrates visualization
TreeGrowth.hs		A simple tree growth example



Visualize output is placed in the file FuSE.R which can be loaded into the 
R statistical program to see visualizations.

Randomized values can be displayed to the console using the printR 
function, which shows the value from a IO monad function.
